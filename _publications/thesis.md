Abstract
------
A study of the elegiac ode as a genre, focusing on three poems: Ben Jonson's "To the Immortal Memory and Friendship of that Noble Pair, Sir Lucius Cary and Sir H. Morison," William Wordsworth's "Ode Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood," and Allen Tate's "Ode to the Confederate Dead." I chose these poems not only for their interest as representatives of the elegiac ode and as well-known poems, but also for their distance from one another in literary history. By choosing poems from such divergent time periods, I hope to show not only a small part of the evolution of the elegiac ode, but also the characteristics that persist across eras.
