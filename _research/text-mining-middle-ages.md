excerpt: 'Some questions that we might pose of medieval corpora that are currently impossible to answer definitively, but that would become possible if we encourage digital scriptoria include: How did genres develop and change over time? What are the salient stylistic features of genres and vernacular literatures? Do these stylistic or topical markers vary across regions within the same language?'

Excerpt
------
A scribe sits at his desk in an uncomfortable chair, laboring over his vellum with pen and ink, squinting in the fading light, and scrawling complaints in the margins about the work conditions. Possibly, his superior chose the text his is copying and the words bear little or no interest to the scribe. Focused, instead, on completing as much of the difficult and tedious task while the light remains, this scribeâ€™s efforts are a vital, unavoidable part of the knowledge economy of the medieval period. Eltjo Buringh estimates that in the fifteenth century alone, more than four million manuscript books were produced in the Latin West through a combination of the labor in monasteries and universities, and by lay scribes. The number of long hours to produce so many manuscripts must have been remarkable. Before the efficiencies of movable type fully replaced the production of manuscripts, the Latin West clearly valued such labor.
