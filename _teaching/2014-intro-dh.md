Description
======
In this course, students explored the perspectives of scholars who have thought about what "digital humanities" means and the technologies and tools that are shaping new kinds of research, scholarship, and publishing. Topics included history of the digital humanities, textual studies, electronic literature, computational and new media, and emerging work around text, image, and new media curation and visualization.

This course was organized as a mix of seminar and workshop and featured a then-new platform, [Lacuna](https://www.lacunastories.com), which also served as a case study for examples of digital humanities projects, scope, infrastructure, and research goals.
