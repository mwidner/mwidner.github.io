In this course, we will study how visual artists deploy rhetoric to convey meaning. As a writing-intensive course, students will be expected to submit several long research papers and drafts. Works studied will include Alan Moore's graphic novel _Watchmen_, Marjane Satrapi's _Persepolis_, editorial cartoons, and Scott McCloud's landmark work _Understanding Comics_.
