How can we study computer code as literature? What can poetry teach us about programming and vice versa? These types of questions drove this course, which had two different tracks: one for computer science students and one for literature students. The focus was on the development of a shared conceptual middle ground at which these two tracks can meet. Topics included critical code studies, code poetry, and cognition. Authors included Elizabeth Bishop, Ada Lovelace, Hayden Carruth, Walt Whitman, Edgar Djisktra, and Donald Knuth.
