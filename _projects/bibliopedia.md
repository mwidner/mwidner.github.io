[Bibliopedia](http://www.bibliopedia.org) provides a platform for organizing, visualizing, sharing, and searching archives without the need for scholars to become experts in metadata or data visualization. It transforms materials into visualized networks to provide new insights into their structure and context. Bibliopedia allows scholars to collaborate on the elaboration and improvement of these materials, is useful for active research, and serves as a gateway to long-term preservation and dissemination.
