[<img style="float:left; margin-right: 10px" src='/images/MAPP_Logo_Orange_Compact.jpg'>](https://www.modernistarchives.com)[The Modernist Archives Publishing Project](https://www.modernistarchives.com) (MAPP) is a critical digital archive of early twentieth-century publishing history. The goal of this site is to display, curate, and describe the documents that go into the making of a book. 

The MAPP collection is growing all the time and contains thousands of images from archives and special collections relating to Virginia and Leonard Woolfâ€™s Hogarth Press including: letters, dust jackets, financial records, paper samples, illustrations, sketches, production sheets, and ephemera. These newly digitized materials come with peer-reviewed summaries, biographies, bibliographical information, and other scholarly materials.

Scholarly Adventures in Digital Humanities

[<img style="float:left; margin-right:10px" src='/images/mapp_book.jpg'>](http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9783319472102)[_Scholarly Adventures in Digital Humanities_](http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9783319472102) addresses the gap between print and digital scholarly approaches by combining both praxis and theory in a case study of a new international collaborative digital project, the Modernist Archives Publishing Project. The twenty-first century has witnessed, and is living through, some of the most dynamic changes ever experienced in the publishing industry, arguably altering our very understanding of what it means to read a book. This book brings to both general readers and scholarly researchers a new way of accessing, and thereby assessing, the historical meanings of change within the twentieth-century publication industry by building a resource which organises, interacts with, and uses historical information about book culture to narrate the continuities and discontinuities in reading and publishing over the last century.
