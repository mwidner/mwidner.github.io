[Experimedia](https://experimedia.stanford.edu) is a design team I manage that supports research and teaching projects in the Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages at Stanford University. They produce posters, video, and websites in the DLCL Digital Humanities Lab, which contains several Macs with multimedia creation software, audiovisual equipment, scanners, and other useful technologies.
