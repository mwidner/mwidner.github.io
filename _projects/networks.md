[Networks of the DLCL](https://web.stanford.edu/dept/DLCL/networks/) visualized relationships among DLCL faculty in advance of an all-faculty retreat at which the agenda was to center around how the DLCL is structured and how well it works for faculty. We developed a series of survey questions that cover research, teaching, collaboration, and service, which I turned into a Google Form so that faculty could fill out a simple web form to provide me with a spreadsheet of data. The questions included things like "What are your primary research topics?" and "With whom have you co-taught?"
