A collaboration with Cécile Alduy, Associate Professor of French, this project examined the rhetoric of French political candidates in the last presidential election and, prior to that, the differences between the rhetoric of Marine le Pen and Jean-Marie le Pen. My contributions included the creation of corpora of several million words, natural language processing (which required the use of high performance computing), and data visualization, which you can [read about here](https://people.stanford.edu/widner/content/text-mining-web). There is also a [website](https://decodingmarinelepen.stanford.edu) to accompany Cécile's book _Marine le Pen prise aux mots: Décryptage du nouveau discours frontiste_.
