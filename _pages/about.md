I am the Vice President of Software Development for a Dallas-area SaaS startup.

I received my PhD in English from the University of Texas at Austin; my dissertation focused on cognitive literary theory and medieval English, French, and Latin literature. For almost six years, I worked as the Academic Technology Specialist for Stanford's [Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages](https://dlcl.stanford.edu), where I was a member of the Stanford Libraries' [Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research](http://library.stanford.edu/department/cidr). In that role, I collaborated with faculty on digital humanities and instructional technology projects. I also [taught courses and workshops on literature and digital humanities](/teaching) and [conceived and developed technology projects](/projects).
