About Me
======

I work as the Academic Technology Specialist for the Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages (DLCL). A member of the Stanford Libraries' [Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research](http://library.stanford.edu/department/cidr), I collaborate with faculty and their research assistants on digital humanities and instructional technology projects. I also teach courses on literature and digital humanities, write software, present workshops, and publish research.
