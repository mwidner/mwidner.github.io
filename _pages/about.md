I am a free-range (i.e., independent) scholar who works in the private technology industry as a Software Development Manager. I received my PhD in English from the University of Texas at Austin; my dissertation focused on cognitive literary theory and medieval English, French, and Latin literature. For almost six years, I worked as the Academic Technology Specialist for Stanford's [Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages](https://dlcl.stanford.edu), where I was a member of the Stanford Libraries' [Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research](http://library.stanford.edu/department/cidr). I have collaborated with faculty on digital humanities and instructional technology projects. I also [taught courses and workshops on literature and digital humanities](/teaching), [conceived and developed technology projects](/projects), and continue to [publish research](/research).

My main projects these days are the [Modernist Archives Publishing Project](https://www.modernistarchives.com), [Lacuna](https://www.lacunastories.com), and the Stanford Global Shakespeare Encyclopedia, forthcoming as a digital publication from the Stanford University Press.
