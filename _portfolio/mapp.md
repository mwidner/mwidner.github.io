About MAPP
------
[The Modernist Archives Publishing Project](https://www.modernistarchives.com) (MAPP) is a critical digital archive of early twentieth-century publishing history. The goal of this site is to display, curate, and describe the documents that go into the making of a book. 

The MAPP collection is growing all the time and contains thousands of images from archives and special collections relating to Virginia and Leonard Woolfâ€™s Hogarth Press including: letters, dust jackets, financial records, paper samples, illustrations, sketches, production sheets, and ephemera. These newly digitized materials come with peer-reviewed summaries, biographies, bibliographical information, and other scholarly materials.
